Beginnings
----------

When I was 13 years old I found in my house a little manual about programming in **GW-BASIC**. Making something with it was a nightmare but also a lot of fun. Just after that, I used **Turbo Basic**, **QBasic**, **QuickBASIC**, **Visual Basic**,... I used to do programs with GUIs and databases. Then I discover **Turbo Pascal**. Things got serious with it, and I started doing some graphical stuff.

Firstly I began doing very simple *videogames*, but then I discover the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene). I learned a lot about *direct video memory access, algorithms, sound cards, low level programming,...* At that time I published my first software: **MagicTXT**. There was no Internet back then, so it was distributed by a diskmag (a magazine delivered in 3.5" floppy disks through ordinary mail).

I switch to **C** and **assembler** and build some interesting *graphic engines* for 2D and 3D. Also I began using **Emacs**, what made me discover *free software* and **Linux**. Little after I started university and my productivity dropped. I kept learning about **C++**, **Python** and Linux by myself, outside the classroom. It was not all time wasted in the University: for my bachelor tesis I worked in *computer vision* with video, and I developed **cvBlob**, my first free software project. And I use **Vim** since then.

After, I got a job working with what I like most: Linux, C++, Python, **Bash**,... all in the server-side trenches.

Nowadays I'm passionated about web servers, scripting, cloud computing,... and much more.
